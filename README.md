This is a Port Scanner using Sockets [ Educational Purpose Only - Never use this for illegal actions ]

Port scanning is used as a surveillance tool that is used in order to identify any open ports available on a particular host, in this case your own network.

Hackers and penetration testers use this technique.

You can get information about open ports, about services running on each port and also about MAC address of the target host [layer 2 protocol - CAM table - Switch rules]

To summarize, network scanning is like a thief who wants to break into your house by checking every door and window to see if any are open.

If you recall from the first video when we talked about TCP/IP protocol suite; which is made of 2 protocols TCP and UDP; and both have from 0 to 65535 ports.

So, it is always recommended to close all unused ports on your network, and these 65535 ports can be divided into : 

1- system or well known ports from 0 to 1023

2- User or registered ports : from 1024 to 49151

3- And Private ports from 49151 and above.
